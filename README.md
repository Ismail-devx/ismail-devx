## About Me
I enjoy understanding systems in depth, from infrastructure and operating systems to the underlying engineering and code. Exploring the logic, design, and complexity behind how systems work, as well as building and improving my own, is what I find most interesting. Analysing other systems has helped me develop a more innovative and problem-solving approach.

I work well in collaborative environments and enjoy contributing as part of a team.
